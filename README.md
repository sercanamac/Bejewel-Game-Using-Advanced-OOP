# Bejewel-Game-Using-Advanced-OOP
This is a course assignment where we use various oop techniques to write a bejewel game that is easy to update. In my implementation you don't even need to write an extra code to add a new type of jewel in to the game, you just need to write the class of the object :). Just follow the instructions in report.pdf to understand the implementation.
